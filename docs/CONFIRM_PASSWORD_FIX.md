# Confirm Password Field - Added

## Issue Fixed

### Error Message:
```
Validation errors:
• Confirm Password: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
```

### Root Cause:
The validation schema (`studentSignupSchema` and `ownerSignupSchema`) requires a `confirmPassword` field, but the signup forms only had a single password field.

---

## Solution

### Added Confirm Password Field

**Student Signup:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-2">
  <label htmlFor="confirmPassword" className="text-sm font-medium">
    Confirm Password <span className="text-red-600">*</span>
  </label>
  <PasswordInput
    id="confirmPassword"
    {...register("confirmPassword")}
    className={errors.confirmPassword ? "border-red-500" : ""}
  />
  {errors.confirmPassword && (
    <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{errors.confirmPassword.message as string}</p>
  )}
</div>
```

**Owner Signup:**
Same field added.

---

## Validation Schema

The schema validates that both passwords match:

```typescript
export const studentSignupSchema = z
  .object({
    fullName: z.string().min(2, 'Full name must be at least 2 characters'),
    email: emailSchema,
    phone: phoneSchema,
    password: passwordSchema,
    confirmPassword: z.string(),  // ← Required field
    collegeId: z.string().min(3, 'College ID is required'),
    collegeName: z.string().min(3, 'College name is required')
  })
  .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
    message: "Passwords don't match",  // ← Shown if passwords differ
    path: ['confirmPassword']
  });
```
