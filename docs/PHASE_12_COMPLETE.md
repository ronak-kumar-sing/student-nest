## 📌 Implementation Notes

### Mock Data
Currently using mock/dummy data for:

- Activity feed items
- Analytics metrics

**To Connect Real Data:**
```typescript
// In dashboard page
const [stats, setStats] = useState({})

useEffect(() => {
  async function loadStats() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/dashboard/stats')
    const data = await response.json()
    setStats(data)
  }
  loadStats()
}, [])
```

### Dashboard State Management
Consider adding for production:
- State management (Zustand/Redux)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- Data caching (React Query)
- Error boundaries

### Future Enhancements
- 📊 Charts and graphs (revenue, occupancy trends)
- 📧 Email notifications
- 🔔 Push notifications
- 📱 Mobile app version
- 🌐 Multi-language support
