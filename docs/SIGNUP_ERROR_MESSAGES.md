# Sign Up Form - Specific Error Messages Update

## What Changed

### Before ❌
When validation failed, you got a generic message:
```
"Please fill in all required fields correctly."
```
No indication of **which** field was wrong or **why** it failed.

### After ✅
Now you get **specific error messages** for each field:

**Toast Notification:** Shows the first field error
```
"Full name is required"
"Invalid email format"
"Password must be at least 8 characters"
"Phone number is required"
"College ID is required"
```

**Console Logs:** Shows ALL errors in detail
```
Validation errors:
• Full Name: Full name is required
• Email: Invalid email format
• Password: Password must be at least 8 characters
• College ID: College ID is required
```

**Inline Field Errors:** Red text appears under each invalid field

## How It Works Now

### Example Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Missing Full Name
**User action:** Click Sign Up with empty name field
**Toast shows:** "Full name is required"
**Inline error:** Red text under Full Name field
**Console shows:** "Form validation failed: { fullName: { message: 'Full name is required' } }"

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Email
**User action:** Enter "test" instead of "test@email.com"
**Toast shows:** "Invalid email format"
**Inline error:** Red text under Email field
**Console shows:** "Form validation failed: { email: { message: 'Invalid email format' } }"

#### Scenario 3: Weak Password
**User action:** Enter "123" as password
**Toast shows:** "Password must be at least 8 characters"
**Inline error:** Red text under Password field
**Console shows:** Full password requirements

#### Scenario 4: Multiple Errors
**User action:** Click Sign Up with several empty fields
**Toast shows:** First error (e.g., "Full name is required")
**Inline errors:** Red text under ALL invalid fields
**Console shows:** Complete list:
```
Validation errors:
• Full Name: Full name is required
• Email: Invalid email format

## Special Case: Email/Phone Not Verified

This is NOT a validation error, but a custom check:

**Message:** "Please verify your email and phone number to continue."
**When:** Both email and phone must have green checkmarks (✓ Verified)
**Console log:** "Verification check failed: { emailVerified: false, phoneVerified: true }"

## Debugging Tips

### If you see "Please fill in all required fields correctly."
This means validation failed but couldn't determine which field.
**Check:** Browser console for the actual validation error object

### If toast shows an error but field looks correct
**Check:**
- Browser console for exact validation rule that failed
- Inline error message under the field (small red text)

### If multiple fields have errors
**Remember:** Toast only shows the FIRST error
**Solution:** Check console for complete list of all errors

### If error persists after fixing field
**Try:**
- Tab out of the field (triggers re-validation)
- Type something and delete it
- Check console to confirm error is gone

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

```typescript
const handleFormSubmit = handleSubmit(
  onSubmit,           // Success callback
  (validationErrors) => {  // Error callback
    // Map internal field names to user-friendly names
    const fieldNames = {
      fullName: "Full Name",
      email: "Email",
      phone: "Phone Number",
      // ...
    }

    // Show first error as toast
    toast.error(firstErrorMessage)

    // Log all errors to console
    console.error("Validation errors:\n" + errorMessages.join("\n"))
  }
)
```

### Field Names Mapping
- `fullName` → "Full Name"
- `email` → "Email"
- `phone` → "Phone Number"
- `password` → "Password"
- `confirmPassword` → "Confirm Password"
- `collegeId` → "College ID"
- `collegeName` → "College Name"
