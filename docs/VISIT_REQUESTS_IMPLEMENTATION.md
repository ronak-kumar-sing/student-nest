# Combined Visit Requests - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully implemented a **unified, bi-directional visit request system** that combines both student and owner visit scheduling into one intelligent, flexible solution.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. VisitRequest Model (`/src/lib/models/VisitRequest.ts`)
**Lines**: 700+
**Features**:
- ✅ Bi-directional initiation (student OR owner can start)
- ✅ Proposal-Response pattern for negotiations
- ✅ Smart status management
- ✅ Version tracking for negotiation rounds
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Virtual properties for computed values
- ✅ Instance methods for all actions
- ✅ Static methods for queries
- ✅ Full TypeScript support

**Key Interfaces**:
```typescript
ITimeSlot - Date + start/end time
IProposal - Who proposed, time slots, message
IResponse - Who responded, action, counter-proposal
IVisitDetails - Confirmed slot, type, requirements
IParticipantInfo - User info + attendance + rating
IVisitRequestDocument - Main document with methods
IVisitRequestModel - Model with static methods
```

---

### 2. API Endpoints

#### `/api/visit-requests` (POST, GET)
**POST - Create Request**:
- Who: Student OR Owner
- Input: Property, recipient, time slots, message
- Logic: Auto-sets status based on initiator
- Validation: Prevents duplicates, checks ownership

**GET - Fetch Requests**:
- Filters: type (sent/received/all), status, filter (pending/upcoming/past)
- Pagination: page, limit
- Statistics: counts by status, pending actions, upcoming visits
- Smart queries: Role-based filtering

#### `/api/visit-requests/[id]` (GET, PUT, PATCH)
**GET - Details**:
- Full request data
- User context (can respond, available actions)

**PUT - Respond**:
- Actions: accept, decline, counter, reschedule, cancel
- Smart validation: Check who can respond
- Status updates: Auto-switches awaiting status

**PATCH - Mark Completed**:
- Both parties mark attendance
- Bi-directional ratings
- Auto-sets status (completed/no_show)

---

### 3. API Client Methods (`/src/lib/api.ts`)

Added 8 new methods:
```typescript
createVisitRequest(data)      // Create new request
getVisitRequests(params)      // Fetch with filters
getVisitRequestDetails(id)    // Get single request
respondToVisitRequest(id, data) // Accept/decline/counter
markVisitCompleted(id, data)  // Mark attendance
getPendingVisitRequests()     // Requests needing action
getUpcomingVisits()           // Confirmed future visits
getVisitRequestStats()        // Get statistics
```

All methods exported for easy import:
```typescript
import { createVisitRequest, respondToVisitRequest } from '@/lib/api';
```

## 🔥 Key Innovations

### 1. True Bi-Directional System
```
OLD System:
├── Student creates → Owner responds
└── One-way only

NEW System:
├── Student creates → Owner responds ← Owner creates → Student responds
└── Works both ways!
```

### 2. Unlimited Negotiation
```
Version 1: Student proposes 3 slots
Version 2: Owner counters with 2 slots
Version 3: Student counters with 1 slot
Version 4: Owner accepts
Result: 4 negotiation rounds tracked!
```

### 3. Smart Status Management
```
Status automatically reflects who needs to act:
- "awaiting_owner" → Owner should respond
- "awaiting_student" → Student should respond
- "confirmed" → Both agreed
- "completed" → Visit happened
```

### 4. Role-Agnostic Logic
```typescript
// Same endpoint for both roles!
if (currentUser.role === 'student') {
  query['student.userId'] = userId;
} else {
  query['owner.userId'] = userId;
}
```

### 5. Complete Audit Trail
```typescript
{
  proposals: [/* All proposals ever made */],
  responses: [/* All responses ever given */],
  version: 4, // Number of negotiation rounds
  lastActivityAt: Date,
  confirmedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date
}
```

---

## 📊 Status Flow

```
Creation
├── Student initiates → status: "awaiting_owner"
└── Owner initiates → status: "awaiting_student"

Negotiation (Unlimited rounds)
├── Counter → Status switches
├── Counter → Status switches
└── Counter → Status switches

Resolution
├── Accept → status: "confirmed"
├── Decline → status: "cancelled"
└── After visit → "completed" or "no_show"
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Student Initiates
```
1. Student sees property → Creates visit request
2. Owner receives → Counters with different times
3. Student → Accepts owner's proposal
4. Status: Confirmed
5. Both attend → Both rate each other
6. Status: Completed
```

### Use Case 2: Owner Proactive
```
1. Owner sees interested student → Creates visit request
2. Student receives → Accepts a time slot
3. Status: Confirmed
4. Student emergency → Requests reschedule
5. Owner → Accepts new time
6. Visit happens
```

### Use Case 3: Multiple Negotiations
```
Student: Proposes times → v1
Owner: Counters → v2
Student: Counters → v3
Owner: Counters → v4
Student: Counters → v5
Owner: Accepts → confirmed

Result: 5 negotiation rounds!
```
