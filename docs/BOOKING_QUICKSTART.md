# Booking System Enhancement - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What's New

I've enhanced your booking system with **3 powerful new endpoints** that provide:

✅ **Comprehensive Analytics** - See occupancy rates, renewal rates, top properties
✅ **Smart Organization** - Bookings categorized by status with helpful flags
✅ **Complete Workflow** - 8 different actions for the entire booking lifecycle
✅ **Extension System** - Full request/approval workflow
✅ **Check-In/Out Management** - Track meter readings, damages, charges

## 🧪 Testing the Enhancements

### Option 1: Automated Test Script

```bash
# Get your tokens first
node get-tokens.js

# Run all tests
node test-booking-enhancements.js <STUDENT_TOKEN> <OWNER_TOKEN>

# Or with environment variables
export STUDENT_TOKEN="your_student_token"
export OWNER_TOKEN="your_owner_token"
node test-booking-enhancements.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing with curl

    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Get My Bookings (All Categories)

## 💻 Using in Frontend

### Import the API Client
```typescript
import { api } from '@/lib/api';
```

### Get Statistics
```typescript
// Student dashboard
const stats = await api.getBookingStatistics('month');
console.log('Total Spent:', stats.data.student.totalSpent);
console.log('Current Booking:', stats.data.student.currentBooking);

// Owner dashboard
const ownerStats = await api.getBookingStatistics('all');
console.log('Occupancy Rate:', ownerStats.data.owner.occupancyRate);
console.log('Renewal Rate:', ownerStats.data.owner.renewalRate);
```

### Get My Bookings
```typescript
// All bookings
const all = await api.getMyBookings('all');

// Only active bookings
const active = await api.getMyBookings('active');

// Bookings expiring soon
const expiring = await api.getMyBookings('expiring');

// Check helper fields
expiring.data.expiring.forEach(booking => {
  console.log('Days until move-out:', booking.daysUntilMoveOut);
  console.log('Can extend?', booking.canExtend);
  console.log('Can cancel?', booking.canCancel);
});
```

### Perform Actions

```typescript
// Owner approves booking
await api.approveBooking(bookingId, 'Welcome to our property!');

// Owner rejects booking
await api.rejectBooking(bookingId, 'Room no longer available');

// Owner checks in student
await api.checkInStudent(bookingId, {
  notes: 'Smooth check-in',
  meterReadings: { electricity: 1234, water: 567 },
  roomCondition: 'All items in good condition'
});

// Student requests extension
await api.requestBookingExtension(bookingId, 3, 'Semester extended');

// Owner approves extension
await api.approveExtension(bookingId, extensionId);

// Student cancels booking
await api.cancelBooking(bookingId, 'Plans changed', 5000);
```

- Reject with reason

### 2. Check-In/Check-Out
Owners can track:
- Meter readings (electricity, water, gas)
- Room condition
- Photos
- Damage/cleaning/utility charges
- Final settlement amount

### 3. Smart Categories
Bookings automatically categorized:
- **Upcoming**: Future move-in dates
- **Expiring**: Move-out within 30 days
- **Overdue Payment**: Pending payment >7 days

### 4. Helper Fields
Each booking includes:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your token is valid: `node get-tokens.js`
- Check token format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### "Booking not found"
- Create a test booking first
- Verify booking ID is correct
- Check user has access to the booking

### "Unauthorized to perform this action"
- Owner actions: approve, reject, check-in, check-out, approve/reject extension
- Student actions: request extension, cancel
- Both can cancel bookings

### "Invalid booking status"
- Check current status matches required status:
  - Approve: PENDING → CONFIRMED
  - Activate: CONFIRMED → ACTIVE
  - Complete: ACTIVE → COMPLETED
