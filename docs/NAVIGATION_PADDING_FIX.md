# Navigation Sidebar & Padding Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Student Navigation Sidebar Not Showing Properly** ✅

#### Problem:
- Student sidebar was not displaying all navigation items
- Only "Messages" was appearing instead of all student menu items

#### Root Cause:
- User role was not being properly normalized from localStorage
- The role might be stored as uppercase "STUDENT" but nav-items filter expects lowercase "student"

#### Solution:
**File: `/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`**
- Added support for both `accessToken` and `token` keys
- Normalized user role to lowercase before setting state
- Added fallback to `userType` field if `role` is not present
- Added console logging for debugging

```typescript
// Normalize role to lowercase
const normalizedRole = userData.role?.toLowerCase() || userData.userType?.toLowerCase() || 'student';

// Set user with normalized role
setUser({
  ...userData,
  signedIn: true,
  role: normalizedRole as "student" | "owner"
});
```

**File: `/src/components/user-sidebar.tsx`**
- Added debug logging to track role filtering
- Ensured proper fallback to 'student' if role is undefined

```typescript
const userRole = user.role || 'student';
console.log("Filtering nav items for role:", userRole);
const filtered = NAV_ITEMS.filter((i) => !i.roles || i.roles.includes(userRole));
console.log("Filtered nav items:", filtered.length, filtered.map(i => i.label));
```

### 2. **Margin/Padding Issues on Visit Requests & Booking Requests Pages** ✅

#### Problem:
- Content was touching the edges of the viewport
- No proper spacing from the header
- Pages looked cramped and unprofessional

#### Solution:

**File: `/src/app/(dashboard)/owner/visits/page.tsx`**
```tsx
// BEFORE
<div className="space-y-6">

// AFTER
<div className="p-6 space-y-6">
```

**File: `/src/app/(dashboard)/owner/bookings/page.tsx`**
```tsx
// BEFORE
<div className="space-y-6">

// AFTER
<div className="p-6 space-y-6">
```

**Changes:**
- Added `p-6` (padding: 1.5rem / 24px) to main container
- This applies padding on all sides: top, right, bottom, left
- Content now has proper breathing room
- Consistent with other dashboard pages

## Owner Navigation Items (Should Display)

When logged in as **Owner**, the sidebar should show:

1. ✅ Owner Dashboard (`/owner/dashboard`)
2. ✅ Booking Requests (`/owner/bookings`)
3. ✅ Visit Requests (`/owner/visits`)
4. ✅ Analytics Dashboard (`/owner/analytics`)
5. ✅ Messages (`/dashboard/messages`)
6. ✅ Post Property (`/owner/post-property`)

## Debugging

### To Check User Role in Console:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. After login, you should see:
   ```
   User data loaded: { role: "student", ... }
   Filtering nav items for role: student
   Filtered nav items: 7 ["Room Browser", "My Bookings", ...]
   ```

### To Check localStorage:

```javascript
// In browser console
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))
// Should show: { role: "student" } or { role: "owner" }
```

### If Navigation Still Not Working:

1. **Clear localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Sign out and sign in again**
   - This will refresh user data with proper role

3. **Check console logs:**
   - Look for "User data loaded:" message
   - Look for "Filtering nav items for role:" message
   - Verify role is lowercase "student" or "owner"
