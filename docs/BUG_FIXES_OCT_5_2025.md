# Bug Fixes Summary - October 5, 2025

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ ObjectId Casting Error for Sample Rooms

**Error:**
```
Cast to ObjectId failed for value "1" (type string) at path "savedProperties"
because of "BSONError"
```

**Location:** `/src/app/api/saved-rooms/route.ts`

**Problem:**
- Sample rooms use string IDs ("1", "2", "3") for demonstration purposes
- MongoDB's `savedProperties` array expects ObjectId types
- When trying to save sample rooms, the code attempted to push string IDs into the ObjectId array, causing a BSONError

**Solution:**
Added early return for sample room IDs to prevent database operations:

```typescript
const sampleRoomIds = [
  '1', '2', '3', // String IDs used in sample data
  '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
  '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',
  '507f1f77bcf86cd799439013',
];

const isSampleRoom = sampleRoomIds.includes(roomId);

// For sample rooms, just return success without saving to database
if (isSampleRoom) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Sample room bookmarked successfully',
    data: {
      savedRoomsCount: 0, // We don't track sample rooms in database
      isSaved: true,
    },
  });
}
```

**Result:**
- Sample rooms can now be "saved" without errors
- Returns success message without attempting database operations
- Real rooms with ObjectId continue to work normally

### 2. ✅ Reviews API - Database Integration

**Status:** Already working correctly

**Location:** `/src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`

**Features:**
- GET endpoint fetches reviews from database using `Review.find({ property: roomId })`
- POST endpoint creates new reviews and updates room ratings
- Proper population of student data (`fullName`, `profilePhoto`)
- Pagination support with `skip` and `limit`
- Returns review summary with average rating

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    reviews: [...],
    pagination: {
      page: 1,
      limit: 10,
      total: 124,
      totalPages: 13,
      hasNextPage: true,
      hasPrevPage: false
    },
    summary: {
      averageRating: 4.5,
      totalReviews: 124
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Reviews are already being fetched from database. If "View All 124 Reviews" shows 0 reviews, it means:
1. No reviews exist in database for that room yet
2. Need to seed review data using seed scripts
