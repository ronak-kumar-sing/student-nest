### 📝 Notes

- All navigation items are correctly configured in `nav-items.ts`
- Role-based filtering works with "student" and "owner" roles (lowercase)
- Old project uses both "student"/"Student" and "owner"/"Owner" - need to handle both
- API client needs to be extended with more methods as pages are created
- Need to ensure TypeScript types are properly defined for all data structures
